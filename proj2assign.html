        <h1>Project 2: Literacy Narrative</h1>
    </section>
    
    <p>The second project in this course asks you to consider and examine your literacy history in order to share with your readers some main theme or insight about your life or experiences as a reader and writer. It is likely that this main theme or insight will be something you yourself weren't aware of before starting this project, something you discover in the process of writing toward the fulfillment of this assignment.</p>

    <p>You will want to think about specific memories, locations, people, problems, successes, questions, and/or patterns that have had some sort of influence on your literacy. You will then form this thinking into a narrative about your life as a writer. The more focused this narrative is—whether on an experience, in regards to some aspect or purpose for writing, on a specific type of writing, or some other area—the better. Your narrative should do more than just "tell what happened"; you should also use your narrative to speculate about the future and reflect on why these memories, problems, questions, etc., happened, or why they matter to your story.</p>

        <h3>Format Choices</h3>
    </section>

    <p>For this project, you will write your narrative in a digital format. You may choose to write your narrative as an audio essay, a video essay, or a documentary photo essay. We will spend time in class looking at the use of various tools that can be used to create these digital essays. These digital essays should be thoughtfully composed, organized, and edited as with a printed essay. You will also include a brief (200-300 words) document with your submission that explains your writing process for this project and why you made the choices that you did.</p>

        <h3>Length Requirements</h3>
    </section>

    <p>This project counts for 5-7 pages of your 20 required pages for the course. A page count equivalent may vary based on various factors, but shoot for the following estimations:</p>
    
    <ul class="w3-ul">
        <ul>Video essay: About 5-7 minutes of composed video</ul>
        <ul>Audio essay: About 8-10 minutes of composed audio</ul>
        <ul>Photo essay: About 15-30 images with captions, depending on caption length</ul>

    <section class="w3-center">
        <h3>Due Dates</h3>
    </section>

    <p>A rough draft that is preferably full-length but at least half complete is due during Week 7 for your writing conference with me. Regardless of your conference date, the draft is due in class on Thursday of Week 7 for peer review. The final draft is due on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the Friday of Week 8.</p>
