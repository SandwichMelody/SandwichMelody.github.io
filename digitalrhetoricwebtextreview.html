    <a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
    <p> Seeing a need for a comprehensive text for the emerging field of digital rhetoric, Douglas Eyman sought to provide "an overview and synthesis of the work that has been done on the development of a digital rhetoric theory and also to provide a framework that situates digital rhetoric as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry in its own right." The result is <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</em>.</p> 

    <p>Eyman sets up the book, published both in print and online (with extra material in the latter), as a "map" and "comprehensive introduction" to the field of digital rhetoric, which Eyman declares has much to offer various other fields. Thus, this work is set up as a sort of guide for recognizing and promoting interdisciplinarity between digital rhetoric and other fields of inquiry.</p>

    <p>Eyman begins <em>Digital Rhetoric</em> with his own technological literacy narrative, citing its popularity in first-year writing courses and its helpfulness in demonstrating the journey through disciplines that led him to his approach to "defining and locating 'digital rhetoric' through the lenses of theory, method, and practice." Because Eyman's experiences with computers, rhetoric, work on <em>Kairos</em>, and other activities follow much of the history of rhetoric as related to computers, his literacy narrative also helps to situate the field of digital rhetoric in history and to begin fulfilling one of his purposes in the book: distinguishing digital rhetoric as a field "in its own right," even if that was not a stated intention for starting with the narrative.</p>

<!--Chapter 1 section-->
  <div id="one">
    <a id="one"><h2>// one // Defining and Locating Digital Rhetoric</h2></a>
    <p>Eyman provides, early in the first chapter, a simple definition of <em>digital rhetoric</em>: "the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances." Starting from the presuppositions that digital rhetoric is not yet a field with "an established community of researchers and practicioners" and that digital rhetoric necessarily owes much of its concepts to rhetoric, Eyman sets out to define <em>digital rhetoric</em> by exploring the "core terms" of the field: <em>rhetoric</em>, <em>digital</em>, and <em>text</em>. The intent behind this approach responsibly examines the pieces to begin examining the whole, but it is somewhat concerning that Eyman does not include the "performances" from his simplified definition as a "core term" to be explored on its own.</p>
    
    <p>After orienting readers to an understanding of "digital," "rhetoric," and "text" as understood by various scholars and fields, Eyman begins to explain how the combined term "digital rhetoric" is understood, defined, and written about. Of particular interest is a distinction between digital rhetoric and Hypertext theory, which Eyman cites as too narrow to be synonymous with digital rhetoric, although meant scholars do conflate the terms.</p>
        
    <p>Eyman is careful to ensure that readers understand that while digital rhetoric does deserve to be classified as a field in its own right, it does still owe much and gain much from classical rhetoric, which acts as a foundation for "analyzing new forms of communication." Rhetoric deals, Eyman says, with the probable, and with multiple reading possibilities, digital rhetoric definitely deals with the probable. </p>
    
    <p>Continuing the distinction of digital rhetoric from other forms, Eyman posits that digital rhetoric is able to draw strengths from other fields while "remaining true to its foundation in rhetoric." Eyman,in fact, names several fields he sees as being relevant to digital rhetoric:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>digital literacy</li>
        <li>visual rhetoric</li>
        <li>new media</li>
        <li>human-computer interaction</li>
        <li>critical code studies</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Eyman cites these fields as avenues for digital rhetoricians to both contribute toward and to learn from. This concluding claim appropriately sets digital rhetoric as a field in its own right by noting the field's ability to have knowledge and insights to offer to other fields and also be founded enough to gain from others, and not simply because it is a part of the field of rhetoric as a whole.</p>

<!--Chapter 2 section-->
  <div id="two">
    <a id="two"><h2>// two // Digital Rhetoric: Theory</h2></a>
    <p>Building on a claim in Chapter 1 that no satisfactory integrated theory of digital rhetoric had been yet articulated, Eyman sets out to "[review] current work on the development and extension of digital rhetoric theory." To start with, Eyman sees three paths for a digital rhetorical theory to embark on, and he claims to favor none by itself:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>apply classical rhetorical theory directly to digital rhetoric</li>
        <li>revise theories for digital rhetoric</li>
        <li>develop an all-new theory from the ground up</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Eyman equates the canons of classical rhetoric with their digital rhetorical practices and notes that especially in digital rhetoric, some of the canons contain overlap in the process of digital composition (such as between invention and arrangement). Arrangement is a "boundary condition" that is just as determined by the audience as by the rhetor because of hypertext and other organizational practices. Eyman rightly, then, considers digital rhetoric to have the power to bridge the gap between producers and consumers of texts.</p>

    <p>In his breakdown of classical canons as applied to digital rhetoric, Eyman does well in pulling in various ideas from other scholars to build on the "basic" applications of the canons. For example, Eyman notes that it is easy to think of memory as storage, but he and other digital rhetoricians are making memory "once again an activity" and "not just a repository." Eyman similarly highlights scholars and works that have revived the canon of delivery in the realm of digital rhetoric.</p>

    <p>Eyman then shifts to contemporary theories of rhetoric with the rhetorical situation, the formation of digital identities with digital rhetoric, and the use of network in digital rhetorical scholarship, continuing to draw on the various theories and works of others to appropriately discuss these concepts in an effort to lay groundwork for his own theory of digital rhetoric, which is "founded on principles of circulation."</p>
    
    <p>It may be somewhat frustrating to read through most of this chapter before Eyman finally feels ready to share his own theory, but it is clear that Eyman is methodically building toward his theory with a "broad overview and selected references" to works that come before and influence his own theory. This theory begins with a thorough discussion of the terms "ecology" and "ecosystem" as scientific concepts linked with networks and systems. Eyman impressively explains how the work of a writer is similar to the energy input of a natural ecosystem, and the "remixing" or adapting of works by others is similar to the material cycling performed by various entities in a natural ecosystem. Ultimately, Eyman brings in theories of capital circulation together with the concepts of ecosystems and ecologies to create the concept of "circulation ecologies" for digital rhetoric.</p>

<!--Chapter 3 section-->
  <div id="three">
    <a id="three"><h2>// three // Digital Rhetoric: Method</h2></a>
    <p>In the third chapter of the book, Eyman analyzes digital rhetoic as an activity, citing Lloyd Bitzer's commentary on rhetoric as something that changes reality through discourse-driven mediation. Eyman starts with an exploration of methods suitable for digital rhetoric from the fields that deal with rhetoric, namely close reading and "distant reading."</p>
    
    <p>It is here where one can see an example of how carefully and methodically Eyman constructs his argument. He takes care to explain that he discusses close and distant reading as methods, despite their being presumed without explanation in the field of rhetoric overall, because so much of digital rhetoric and composition is defined as distinct from print-based rhetoric and composition and as needing "digital-native methods." The care Eyman takes to articulate and provide the rationale for each articulation is a key strength in a book that sets out to do so much toward defining and contextualizing what Eyman posits is a field of its own.</p>

    <p>Next, Eyman refers to the current shift in composition studies away from a view of writing as performed by a solitary author seeking limited publication possibilities to a more collaborative act afforded with multiple options for circulation before announcing that the field of technical and professional communication's methods are especially relevant to methods in digital rhetoric. Usability is helpful because it provides a "methodology for studying both writing practices and writing pedagogies—and because it takes both system and user into consideration." The field of digital writing studies likewise has much to offer digital rhetoric in terms of methods, namely its greater focus on context and not just the rhetorical situation but also the textual and social situations.</p>
    
    <p>Eyman then turns his attention to fields that normally do not deal with rhetoric on a foundational or methodological basis. Many of these fields are centered somehow around computers. Network administration tools, server log analysis, social network analysis, hypertext network analysis, and bibliometrics and cybermetrics all provide digital rhetoric studies with methods that provide additional information such as how large of an audience a text travels to, how it travels, where it travels to, where it resides, and so on. Other fields deal greatly with calculations and are thus dependent on or aided by computers. Content analysis and data visualization further help aid methodology in digital rhetoric by determining and displaying the frequency, presence, or use of certain elements in a text.</p>
    
    <p>Many of these fields would seem at first to be too far from the realm of digital rhetoric or "plain" rhetoric itself to be useful, that instead they look at raw, non-rhetorical data and are thus insignificant to the questions of rhetoric. Yet Eyman discusses the use of each method and its usefulness for various digital rhetorics. The inclusion of such details and considerations demonstrates the meticulous comprehensiveness of Eyman's work.</p>

<!--Chapter 4 section-->
  <div id="four">
    <a id="four"><h2>// four // Digital Rhetoric: Practice</h2></a>
    <p>Eyman breaks the practice of digital rhetoric into three categories: pedagogy, publication about digital rhetoric, and digital text production. Each of these categories is given its own space for discussion in this chapter.</p>
    
    <p>In the section on pedagogy in digital rhetoric, Eyman provides three examples of courses that have dealt with digital rhetoric in some way, ranging from a seminar on digital rhetoric to a web authoring and design course that included digital rhetoric as collective factor in the production of web sites. With each example, Eyman provides the course title, description, major projects, and connection to digital rhetoric. These help to provide readers of Eyman's work with tangible support for their understanding of the definition and methods of digital rhetoric as discussed in <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</em>.</p>
    
    <p>The section on scholarship in digital rhetoric features a similar structure of discussion through examples and is actually itself broken down into two more focused sections: "Scholarship of Digital Rhetoric" and "Scholarship <em>as</em> Digital Rhetoric" (emphasis original). By Eyman's own admission, the more exciting of the two is the latter because it represents "new forms of scholarship that can take advantage of the affordances of new media digital texts." In providing examples of such scholarship, Eyman is careful not to spend much time describing their content, citing both the fact that such digital-born scholarship depended on its mode of transmission and an intention to focus less on what the scholarship said and more on why it matters as an example of the practice of digital rhetoric. This is a fitting distinction that respects the authorship and text of the original scholarship.</p>
    
    <p>Some of these reasons include the existence of non-verbal yet communicative scholarship, the presence of nodes of a work that "enact" rather than act as examples of the argument, the awareness of digitally-produced scholarship indeed as scholarship and as labor-intensive, and ability of units of a digital composition to work together and separately.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, Eyman provides numerous examples of digital rhetoric productions. In the online version of the text, each of these examples is given a hyperlink that directs readers to view the samples, which range from YouTube music mashups to parodies to a site where musician Peter Gabriel invites fans to remix his music and upload their creations to the site. One of the most prominent and highlighted examples, however—of a young politician who produced various digital texts for a campaign, including a message in HTML code for constituents who would view the source code—does not have a link. Eyman points out that some of the digital texts he references in earlier drafts have since disappeared and uses this moment to call for "digital rhetoric scholars to archive the digital products they study" and for digital rhetoricians to engage in more case studies. This, along with links to suggested sites for persuing digital rhetoric scholarship, serves as an appropriate ending to Eyman's discussion of digital rhetoric.</p>

<!--Final thoughts section-->
<div id="final">
    <a id="final"><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></a>
    <p>It is clear that in <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</em>, Douglas Eyman is continuing and building on previous conversations and reflections on the nature of digital rhetoric, a difficult-to-define field within a field that is itself hard to pin down (yet, as Eyman asserts, digital rhetoric is a field in its own right). This is seen most prominently in Eyman's continual response to an earlier work on digital rhetoric by James P. Zappen (<em>Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory</em>). Eyman's work is carefully articulated in order, intentionally it seems, to place the realm of digital rhetoric in a broad yet defined landscape. Although Eyman sometimes suggests gaps in the work of others, his work respects the scholarship of others, building upon it rather than tearing it down.</p>
    
    <p>It is also clear that this book is the result of much thought and research, which is fitting considering Eyman's stance on digital rhetoric as a broad field that has much to give and much to receive from other disciplines. This book is one that can assuredly guide digital rhetoricians—both new and experienced—in better understanding, defining, and engaging in the field.</p>
